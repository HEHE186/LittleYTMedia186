Note:Not all of this is finished, I update the Repo when I add a new file, all videos are put in categories inside folders for the individual YouTuber.
This is a way to watch YouTube videos offline, NOT to republish videos. All YouTubers are credited by their folder name for heir videos matching their channel name.
